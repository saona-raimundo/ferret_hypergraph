# ferret_hypergraph

Hypergraph data structure library.

## Naming

I like ferrets :) (and `hypergraph` was already used).

## Limitations

- There is no way to choose hasher. 
  This is to not introduce yet another type parameter for `Hypergraph`. 

# For the reader

Has this project been useful to you? How? :)
Let me know through a github issue!
